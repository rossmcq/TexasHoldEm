TexasHoldEm card game simulator
Needs some work and tidying up, 
I'm sure there's a lot of best practises that I'm not coding to as I'm not familiar with them,
I'm open to any improvement suggestions :)

1) To start run TexasHoldem.py to start the game engine
2) Users connect to the game engine by running TexasHoldEmUser.py

#TODO: 
1) HeaderString in messages
2) Game Logic:

    i) Betting/Raising
    
    ii) Calculate Winning Hand (currently just highest card wins)
    
    iii) merge games if not many players

3) Logging

4) Alerting
5) User log in/retain chips 


UI?
