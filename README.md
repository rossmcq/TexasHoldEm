# TexasHoldEm
TexasHoldEm card game simulator
Needs some work, just getting started!

1) To start run TexasHoldem.py to start the game engine
2) Then users need to connect to the gameengine by running TexasHolEmUser.py


#TODO:
1) Return GameID to user
2) Kick of seperate games on different process
3) UI?
